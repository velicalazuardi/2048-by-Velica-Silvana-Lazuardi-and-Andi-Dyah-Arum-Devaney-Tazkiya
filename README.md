You play it by running the Python file, and once the game appears,
you move the tiles using W to move up,
A to move left,
S to move down,
and D to move right.
Each move pushes all tiles in the chosen direction,
combining tiles with the same value into a larger number.
After every valid move, a new tile appears on the board.
You keep playing until the board is completely full with no possible merges left, or you press Q to quit the game.

This game was created by Velica Silvana Lazuardi in collaboration with Andi Dyah Arum Devaney Tazkiya, 
howcasing their early steps in game development and logical programming.
